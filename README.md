# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used consists of historical stock prices, and several preprocessing techniques were applied to prepare the data for model training. Various models were implemented, and their performance was evaluated based on accuracy and other key metrics.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset underwent cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction to make it suitable for model training.
- **Models Implemented**: Several machine learning models were used, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion matrix, accuracy, and other evaluation metrics were used to assess model performance.

### Results
- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy.
- **Model Limitations**: While the models achieved reasonable performance, stock prices are inherently volatile, and more sophisticated techniques (such as deep learning) might yield better results.

### Visualizations
- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix was plotted to evaluate the performance of the models on the validation data.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Graphs showing model performance were included to visually compare different models.

### Tools & Frameworks
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation.
  - Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and metrics.
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

## Conclusion
The machine learning models provided reasonable predictions for stock prices, but improvements can be made by using more complex algorithms such as deep learning. The stock market's volatility poses challenges, and further exploration with different datasets or feature engineering may enhance prediction accuracy.

## Future Work
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implement models like LSTM or GRU to capture time-series dependencies better.
- **Feature Engineering**: Include more financial indicators and external factors such as news sentiment.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further tuning of model parameters could improve performance.
